- This site was built by me for my final project at BLOC(Web Developer Program). I would like to give a huge thank you to my mentor Kinsey for her incredible support and dedication to my pursuit to learn the back end of web development via javascript and ruby. Without her, the world of back end web development would forever have remained a mystery to me.
